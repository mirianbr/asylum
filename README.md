## Disclaimer and inspiration sources

This game/IF is by no means an attempt to represent actual psychiatry treatments or installations. If you're interested in how this is going in real life (as far as I'm aware, _very_ slowly), take a look at the [deinstitutionalization movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation). 

For inspiration only, however, I used a number of sources you may want to check out.

### Books

* Madness in civilization, by Andrew Scull
* Fadas no divã, by Diana and Mario Corso (to my knowledge, this book was never translated to English; it's about psychoanalysis themes in fairy tales and contemporary children's stories, similar to Bruno Bettelheim's Uses of Enchantment, but with a different and contemporary reading)
* Como a mente funciona, by Steven Pinker (translated from How the Mind Works)
* Jung e o Tarô, by Sallie Nichols (translated from Jung and Tarot: An Archetypal Journey)
* O alienista, by Machado de Assis (original for [The alienist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_alienista))

### Movies

* [One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073486/)
