# Asylum

My Interactive Fiction (IF) attempt during [Ludum Dare 49](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/) - themed "Unstable".

## Scenario

A mental asylum. An unstable patient. Not many options, not that many endings.

## Bibliography

This game/IF is by no means an attempt to represent actual psychiatry treatments or installations. If you're interested in how this is going in real life (as far as I'm aware, _very_ slowly), take a look at the [deinstitutionalization movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation). 

For inspiration only, however, I used a number of sources. I'll list them below until the end of the jam (promise!).
